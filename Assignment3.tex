\begin{abstract}
This assignment will involve the modification of the Linux Yocto kernel. 
The kernel will be modified to add a custom encrypted block device, which we will design and implement. 
The solution will use the Linux Kernel's Crypto API to add encryption when reading and writing data. 
The solution will comprise of a RAM Disk device driver which allocates blocks of memory. 
The solution will first be implemented in the kernel directly for ease of testing, and will subsequently
 be moved to a module with module parameters used for the encryption and decryption of the data. 
This document will provide documentation and design details for the encrypted block device driver.

\section{Work Log}
\subsection{November 22nd, 2016 - 10:20 am}
Started write up, including documentation and design of encrypted block device driver. 
Added script to generate version control log table from git history.

\subsection{November 22nd, 2016 - 10:30 am}
Added Makefile. Updated Makefile to include the autogeneration of the git commit log when running make. 
Added a line in the makefile to remove the changelog.tex file with make clean so that a new one gets 
generated when make is run.
