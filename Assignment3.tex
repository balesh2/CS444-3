\begin{abstract}
This assignment will involve the modification of the Linux Yocto kernel. 
The kernel will be modified to add a custom encrypted block device, which we will design and implement. 
The solution will use the Linux Kernel's Crypto API to add encryption when reading and writing data. 
The solution will comprise of a RAM Disk device driver which allocates blocks of memory. 
The solution will first be implemented in the kernel directly for ease of testing, and will subsequently
 be moved to a module with module parameters used for the encryption and decryption of the data. 
This document will provide documentation and design details for the encrypted block device driver.

\section{Work Log}
\subsection{November 22nd, 2016 - 10:20 am}
Started write up, including documentation and design of encrypted block device driver. 
Added script to generate version control log table from git history.

\subsection{November 22nd, 2016 - 10:30 am}
Added Makefile. Updated Makefile to include the autogeneration of the git commit log when running make. 
Added a line in the makefile to remove the changelog.tex file with make clean so that a new one gets 
generated when make is run.

\subsection{November 22nd, 2016 - 10:50 am}
Added sections in documentation for purpose of assignment and testing. Started content for testing 
section and finished content for purpose of assignment section.

\section{Purpose of Assignment}
The purpose of this assignment is to understand encrypted block devices through the implementation of 
our own RAM Disk device driver in the Linux Yocto Kernel. 
Our solution will take the form of a kernel module, for the purpose of understanding how to develop a 
kernel module. 
The driver will encrypt and decrypt the data as it is read and written, and will handle the case where 
the block is not big enough for the amount of data. 
Through implementing this driver, we will learn how drivers are written, how block devices work, and 
how encryption is implemented. 
We will additionally learn how to test a kernel module, encryption, and block devices.

\section{Testing Methods}
Since testing kernel modules is difficult, we will begin by directly implementing the RAM Disk device 
driver in the kernel, without encryption, then adding encryption, then extracting to a module. 
This will allow us to easily test the basic fuctionality first, then once that has been proven to work 
correctly, extract to a module and test the module functionality.
